## Overview

This project is an adaption of [towards data science](https://towardsdatascience.com/train-undying-flappy-bird-using-reinforcement-learning-on-java-98ff68eb28bf) to play [Pathery] (https://pathery.com) .
It integrates [Deep Java Library (DJL)](https://github.com/awslabs/djl) to uses DQN to train agent.
